This file comprises all the work necessary for Homework 1 in ECGR4105. In order to run the code correctly, you must open the file in Colab and run the code either
step by step or select run all in the Colab toolbar. To be safe, I recommend selecting  restart session and run all. The file includes the answers to the questions posed in 
Part 1, however, I will also include the answers in a separate report.
